  <p>One of the most useful things you can do to prepare for debate is to read as much as possible. My goal here isn’t to convince you this is necessary, but rather to provide a few quick suggestions for how to find good readings. It’s also not to talk about how to make good use of readings, because that’s much more dependent on what specifically you’re reading.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>I find it useful to divide debate-relevant literature into two categories<sup class="footnote"><span class="fn-outer-wrapper"><span class="fn-inner-wrapper">I&#x27;m using these words informally and slightly detatched from their academic meaning; this is just a useful distinction for how I think about reading literature for the purpose and in the context of debate.</span></span></sup>
: theory and practice. These are about what you’d expect: roughly, theory is a broad discussion of how something (economics, international relations, patriarchy, etc) operates, and practice is the application of theory to some specific concept (for instance, using a specific theory of international relations to analyze North Korea). While most of debate looks more like practice than like theory, theory is extremely helpful - a better theoretical knowledge of economics will help you understand complicated concepts during prep and explain them in round.</p>
<h3 id="academic-articles">Academic Articles</h3>
<p>In the future, I’m hoping to produce a list of introductory readings to a number of debate-relevant categories of theory. For now, these steps should be helpful.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask! Contact anyone in the debate community you know, ask your teachers or school librarian, or even email random professors - many are happy to speak to interested high schoolers and answer questions. Most of these people can also help you get articles from behind paywalls - professors don’t like publishing companies and are usually willing to send PDFs of their articles, school libraries often have subscriptions, and debate coaches have ways ;).</li>
<li>Use university syllabi. Syllabi, at their best, function as annotated reading lists curated by an expert in a field. For instance, say you wanted to learn about the Middle East - googling “intro to middle eastern politics syllabus” got me <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/content/dam/nyu/globalPrgms/documents/WashingtonDC/Syllabi/Spring_2019_Accessible/Syl_WashingtonDC_POL-UA%209540-001%20DC1_Goldman_Spring2019%20Syllabus.pdf">this</a> syllabus from NYU as the first result; it’s a good bet that the readings, especially the two required books, represent an accessible introduction to the field.</li>
<li>Look at citations. Often news articles will cite professors - look them up on google scholar and find their work. If you’re confused about an article, google scholar has a great “cited by” feature which will let you find other articles which reference yours - understanding more about the academic context of the work often helps clarify it.</li>
<li>Use crowdsourced libraries or recommendations. There are many shared libraries for all sorts of content areas – google is your friend.</li>
<li>On that subject, learn <a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/google-advanced-search-operators/">google search operators</a>. Some highlights: “text” for exact matches, -text to exclude, filetype:pdf for pdfs (which are usually more technical).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="news-periodicals">News/Periodicals</h3>
<p>I think the importance of reading news for parli is pretty obvious, and even if it’s not the middle of the season, it’s still good to practice reading news in a rigorous way and not just be a passive reader. Part of the goal of understanding theory is to reduce your dependence on using new articles for arguments during round - this takes a lot of time in prep and the arguments are often not great - but you will always need to read articles to understand the context behind the resolution and to get useful empirics/stats. Here are some drills that can help you with that.</p>
<ul>
<li>Skim an article (ideally a minute or less) and then write a one-sentence summary of the article. This will help you figure out quickly during prep if articles have useful content.</li>
<li>Find an opinion piece to write an entire aff based on. Keep track of which parts of the aff you used the article for, and which parts you came up with. I think we’re all familiar with those preps where you find the one goldmine article that writes the whole aff for you; this will help identify articles that can do that.</li>
<li>Read an article and write down its underlying theoretical assumptions - most mainstream American articles about IR, for instance, are making assumptions that America should broadly be concerned with the security of its citizens before the security of others. This will help you figure out the theoretical perspectives behind your arguments, which is useful in prep, and for those of you who are into K debate, it’ll also help generate links.</li>
<li>Pick some periodicals to read regularly, especially during the season, and familiarize yourself with their tone, their ideological backround, and even specific journalists. I tend to read the BBC and Al-Jazeera, and when I was competing I often added Reuters and the New York Times.</li>
</ul>
