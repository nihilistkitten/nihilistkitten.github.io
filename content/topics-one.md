This is part one of a series on topic construction in parliamentary debate. In this article, I want to consider what function topics serve in rounds and how we can utilize those functions to create the more equitable and educational rounds we can.

Some content warnings: there are specific examples of topics in this article which involve racist police actions, [more].

I'm thankful to the National Parliamentary Debate League for their [well-organized repository](https://www.parliamentarydebate.org/resolutions) of tournament resolutions, which was extremely helpful for this article, and from which most of my example resolutions are sourced. I'm also thankful to [people] for their feedback on earlier drafts.

## Preliminaries

Some immediate caveats apply. About me: the vast majority of my experience lies in high school parli, and so that's the format this is geared towards. Additionally, I haven't been active in parli for the last semester, so my thinking may be slightly out of date. Finally, while I want to try to make this broadly applicable, my tendencies in debate lean specifically towards the K and in general towards tech, and some of those beliefs might come through here.

That said, I do want to try to operate within the existing high school parli landscape, in which judges amenable to Ks and theory are relatively few and far between. This is because topics should be written to for the realities of debate as it exists: when they can push debate to be more kritikal (and I'll talk about some examples of this below), I obviously think that's awesome, but I think largely they need to be reactive to trends in judging; teams don't deserve to lose because the topic writer thought the core neg ground was kritikal but the judge is paradigmatically anti-K. A good example of this is [Evergreen 2021 Semis](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wogxnF_EfXlJH-zhW5InGw7msdmA17JwCdDpqk_vKRU/edit): _The US Department of Justice should open an investigation into the New York Police Departmentâ€™s involvement in the assassination of el-Hajj Malik el-Shabazz._ There is absolutely fantastic neg K ground but the topic is very hard to negate in the context of judges who are strongly predisposed against wholesale criticisms of the state and/or policing.

I also want to say explicitly here that none of my criticisms of topics are criticisms of their authors; everyone writes bad topics sometimes, and my disagreement with a topic's construction does not represent anything other than that.

## Topics as Division of Ground

A topic, at its core, serves to divide ground between the affirmative and negative{{ footnote(content="In debates with plans, this looks slightly different: the topic constrains possible affirmatives and the plan divides ground. I'll talk more about this later.") }}. This is an oft-repeated phrase, and I think there are at least two senses in which it's true. First, again based on most status quo judging, the affirmative is largely constrained to affirmation of the topic and the negative is constrained to negation of it: the topic divides the space of possible advocacies. For instance, on NPDL-TOC 2021 4c: _The US federal government should significantly reduce its sanctions on Iran without preconditions._, the phrase "without preconditions" obviously precludes (topical) affirmatives from advocating conditional reductions in sanctions.

Second, topics functionally divide the space of possible arguments. This is a slightly fuzzier concept, and different topics do it in different ways, so let me give some examples of what I mean by it, putting aside (for now) wording ambiguities in some of these topics.

## What makes a topic good?

- Equitable
- Even division of ground (ground is an equity issue --Sierra)
  - Broad affirmative flex
  - Predictable negative ground
- Access to literature

Secondary concerns:

- Interest
- Broad Scope

## Potpourri

- Inherency
- Resolution Flaws
- Info Slides
- Topic Areas
