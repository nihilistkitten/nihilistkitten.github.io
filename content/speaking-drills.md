These are some short notes on how to fit more content into your speech. The most significant restriction on your arguments, regardless of style, is that you cannot make them after the timer beeps. Therefore, fitting more arguments, deeper analysis, and/or a more coherent narrative into the time you have is in your interest. Much of the time, faster, more efficient debaters win rounds not because they go for quantity over quality or because they spread out their opponent; they win because they’re able to fit deeper, better-explained analysis into the same speech time.

I've divided these into two categories: efficiency and speed/clarity{{ footnote(content="Even if you aren’t interested in speed, I encourage you to read the section, there’s a lot in it that you can apply to any format of debate at any speed.") }}. These are opinionated lists: there are other speed, efficiency, and clarity drills, but I chose what I think are the best.

## Being More Efficient

These drills are designed to help you communicate more information in less time/fewer words, without having to speak faster or sacrifice persuasiveness. This is one of the most useful skills in debate because it applies to every speech, in front of every judge, with every type of argument.

- Practice how you articulate certain concepts. Things like your top of case, or a common impact story (think poverty, global warming, etc), can be super-optimized to save you a ton of time. This will also force you to think about how to cut words, which will help you be word economical elsewhere.
- Give a “hell mg”. Write a PMC, then give someone who you trust is good at debate a long time (maybe even overnight) to write a 12+ minute LOC. Give yourself a little bit (3-4 minutes) of prep and then give an MG. This drill is amazing not just because it forces you to be economical, but also because it makes you think about MG argument selection in a nuanced way - you need to pick which arguments in the PMC/LOC are important to extend/answer.
- Give time-crunched speech redos. Take some old flows and plan a redo of a speech you didn’t think was great, then give the redo. After that, try to give the same speech in one minute{{ footnote(content="This could be anywhere from thirty seconds to two minutes; keep going down in increments that work for you.") }} less time without speeding up - the only way you’ll be able to do that is by being more word economical. Keep subtracting time until you get stuck.

### Filler Words

One of the primary causes of inefficient (and unpersuasive) speech is filler words: “um,” “like,” etc. The goal is not to eliminate filler words - that’s impossible - but just to reduce how often we say them. It’s also not to replace them with silence, but rather to replace them with additional argumentation.

- Record your speeches (online debate helps a lot here) and keep track of how many times you say certain words. Even better, transcribe your speeches verbatim, including sounds you make (use onomatopoeias!). Many debaters develop their own filler words{{ footnote(content="I have no idea how many times I’ve said an impact will “probably” happen or that we’re winning “insofar as” we win the disad. I once said “probably” fourteen times (I counted the recording) in a PMR once where I made what the judge said would’ve been a winning argument five seconds off time, and so we lost.") }}; if you’re using a word or phrase multiple times and it doesn’t add any significant content, it’s a filler word, and knowing that is the first step to eliminating it!
- Pick a topic (or better, have a friend or family member pick a topic) and talk about it for as long as possible without filler words. As soon as you use one, restart with a new topic - time the speeches and see if you can beat yourself! In general, you want someone who can listen and tell you if you use a filler word, but if that’s not possible, recording the speech works as well.
- Following the same process as the last drill, try to tell a story without using filler words. This is usually more difficult, because it requires you to have some sort of narrative momentum, as opposed to just listing facts about the topic.

## Going Faster

All of these drills involve taking a file, news article, etc (preferably something you haven’t seen before), and reading them out loud in some specific way. You could also flow your file beforehand and do these drills off paper -- that has the added benefit of familiarizing you with your own handwriting and shorthand and can help with file memorization. I’ve separated the drills for speed and for clarity, but these things build on each other. Even if you have no interest in fast debate, the speed drills build muscle memory and strength which will make it easier for you to project, for instance. And if you do want to do fast debate, you need to do clarity drills - speed isn’t useful if no one can understand you. For that reason, if these drills ever get too easy, combine them! Read a file backwards with a pen in your mouth, for instance.

Practicing speaking is like learning a language - it’s much better to practice a little bit every day than do it all at once. Like a language, speed is only partially “use it or lose it” - you’ll slow down if you don’t practice, but once you develop speed you’ll retain some of it. The most important time to practice is leading up to tournaments. You should try to pick several of these drills that you find helpful and do them for 3-5 minutes every day, or a few times per week. If you are interested in speed, you can also turn this into a little competition with yourself to see how fast you improve. However, please don’t do this for more than 30 minutes at once - you don’t want to hurt your voice.

### Speed

The basic idea is to train yourself to be able to speak without internally processing what you’re saying, which will allow you to speak faster. That’s why many of these drills involve reading some form of nonsense.

- Do the word economy drills (above). Seriously, efficient word economy is way more important than words per minute.
- Go as fast as you can - challenge yourself!
- Pick some word (I like the dictionary.com word of the day, for variety, but “multiplication” or “watermelon” are good defaults) and place it between every word in your file.
- Read your file backwards.
- Read off of [randomtextgenerator](http://www.randomtextgenerator.com/) or [pomogenerator](http://www.elsewhere.org/journal/pomo/).

### Clarity

These all help in some way with making your speech more understandable. They train you to subconsciously utilize all the different parts of the vocalization process that you normally ignore.

- Speak slowly and enunciate every syllable - essentially, pretend that every word has a space separating each syllable from the next.
- Read tongue twisters! These are a lot of fun, and the reason they’re hard is because they force your vocal muscles to do weird things, which is exactly what we want.
- Bite a pen between your back teeth while speaking. For some syllables, we instinctively rely heavily on tongue movements to form a coherent sound and neglect the other tools (mouth shape, etc) that we have to control our voices. This will train you to use those.
- Force your tongue to stay at the roof of your mouth while speaking. This is similar to the previous drill and may provide some variety, or be helpful if the pen is too uncomfortable.

## Conclusion

Rounds are won or lost on lots of things -- argumentative quality, persuasive speaking, strategic thinking -- but being able to make your arguments on time is a prerequisite to being successful at any of those. I hope this set of drills will help y’all have deeper, more interesting debates, and also win some rounds.
